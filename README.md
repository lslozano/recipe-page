### The Challenge

## My process

1.- Created the full DOM structure without focusing on semantics initially, to get a quick visual skeleton of the layout.

2.- Applied general layout styles to establish spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.

3.- Added global styles such as fonts, colors, and base resets to ensure consistency across the project.

4.- Refactored the layout into isolated, reusable React components to improve readability and modularity.

5.- Polished the visual styling to match the design as closely as possible, focusing on a pixel-perfect result.

6.- Migrated styles into CSS Modules to scope styles locally and avoid potential conflicts.

7.- Updated the HTML structure to use semantic elements, improving accessibility and code clarity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build Tool

### What I learned

- Set up a React development environment using Vite, gaining a better understanding of project structure and tooling from the start.
- Practiced building from general layout and global styles down to component-specific details, aiming for a clean and scalable styling approach.
- Worked on achieving pixel-perfect implementation based on a design reference, while ensuring semantic HTML structure for better accessibility and maintainability.
- Learned how to customize list styles using CSS, including positioning and styling bullet points with precision.
- Continued improving my attention to detail, both visually and in terms of code structure and organization.
- Deploy a Vite project to github pages.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Docs](https://vite.dev/guide/) - This helped me setup the environment to work on the project.
- [Geek for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-tables/) - This helped me to work on the table that was needed.
- [W3 Org](https://www.w3.org/) - Served as a reference to create a semantic and accessible HTML.
